The "Auto" layout automatically styles up to 12 Paragraph items in a single row
based on the number of field items placed inside a Paragraphs field. It is a
responsive layout that collapses to a single column on smaller screens.

Note: The `items_count` parameter must be passed through for it to function
properly.
