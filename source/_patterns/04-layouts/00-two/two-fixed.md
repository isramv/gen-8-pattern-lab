title: 2-Column Fixed
state: documentation
---

The *2-Column Fixed* layout styles the direct element descendants in 2
columns of even proportion, taking up 50% on the left and 50% on the right.
It is not a responsive layout and remains a 2-column layout regardless of
screen size.

It can be used via the `layout.twig` template, with `2_fixed` as the layout.
